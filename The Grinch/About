Stole Christmas!" which remains a timeless favorite during the holiday season. In this version, 
Boris Karloff provides the voice for both the Grinch and the narrator.

Regardless of the adaptation, "The Grinch" is a tale cherished for its heartwarming message 
about the true spirit of Christmas and the transformative power of kindness and love.
